%3:43 PM!!!
I sat up in the dark, under a pink floral cover on a queen mattress.  My small Samsung Galaxy tablet laid on the bed beside me, its screen bathing the ceiling a blue glow.  A noise reverberated around the room, and held my attention.  I peered suspiciously, trying to make out any image revealed by the faint moonlight.  The lack of discernible sound only served to punctuate that noise.  All the everyday sources of light and sound I had become accustomed to-- the suburban symphony of purring engines, passing headlights, whistling air conditioning and glowing streetlamps-- had absented.

The word 'disquietude' fit this situation like the last piece of a puzzle.  I uneasily pushed my earbuds back in to quiet the silence and turned up the volume for good measure.  I relaxed, lowering myself back down to the pillow and regaining my second chin as my gaze fixed to my device once again.  As I returned to the lull, I believed the storm to have cleared around me.  In reality, I had only passed into the eye of it.

\textit{Crumble crumble.}  The noise had returned.  Having better recognized the sound, I rolled off the bed like a sideways whirling dervish.  I flicked the light switch and assuming a defensive stance.  The overhead light flooded the room with a stale yellow light.  Crumbling?  \textit{Are the walls breaking?}, I worried, casting glances in all directions.  Though some portion of me knew that my parents would never, never, never rent a house which showed any semblance of decay or danger, I couldn't help but mull it over.

My gaze held onto the wall opposite to my bed; surely that was where the sound had originated.  It had been adorned with a few landscape paintings and displayed an unassuming door to what I believed to be a closet.  The wooden door-- locked, as I had discovered when I tried to turn its brass handle earlier that day-- felt foreboding.  I felt uneasy as I watched myself move forward, like a third party in my own body.  The firm, tan carpet, laid thinly over a base of a stony material, felt hard against my bare feet.

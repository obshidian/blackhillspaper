%3:43 PM!!!
I sat up in the dark, under a pink floral cover on a queen mattress.  My small Samsung Galaxy tablet laid on the bed beside me, its screen bathing the ceiling a blue glow.  A noise reverberated around the room, and held my attention.  I peered suspiciously, trying to make out any image revealed by the faint moonlight.  The lack of discernible sound only served to punctuate that noise.  All the sources of light and sound I had become accustomed to-- the normal suburban symphony of engines, headlights, air conditioning and streetlamps-- had absented.

The word ``disquietude'' always sounded oddly cool to me, and it described this situation perfectly.  I uneasily pushed my earbuds back in to quiet the silence and felt for the volume buttons, setting it up a few levels for good measure.  I relaxed, lowering myself back down to the pillow and regaining my second chin as my gaze fixed to my device once again.

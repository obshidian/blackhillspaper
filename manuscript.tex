So there I was, sitting on a bed in a house we'd rented in South Dakota.  I was probably ``multitasking'' by messaging correspondents about programming on something like Twitter and half-watching Netflix or whatever I was on a binge of at the time.  I sat there, convinced I was doing something when I really wasn't doing anything except decreasing my life expectancy.  The way I sat made me look like I was on the verge of adding 'second chin' to my list of defining characteristics.

I think the digital clock at my bedside, looking straight out of the 90s with its blocky red LCD digits, read around 12:30 at the time.  A.M., that is.  My parents would've been thoroughly disappointed had they known I was fooling around on the internet at a time like this, but I thought I needed ``sleep'' like I thought I needed water--  just enough to get me through the day.  I was nearing the point of merging into the bed entirely at the time when I was suddenly drawn back to planet Earth by a noise.

Crumbling.  It sounded like crumbling, like some kind of fragile, chalky stone falling down stairs.  The wall opposite to my bed seemed to be its source.  I hoped to god that this house wasn't caving in.  Rather than resorting to reason, my mind instinctively assumed this was some omen foretelling that the house, in all umpteen tons of its woody aesthetic and beautiful architecture, would cave in on my poor soul.  The noise stopped as suddenly as it appeared, though, and didn't come back for a good while.  After a minute, my heart rate settled.  Even then, though, as I continued to do absolutely nothing, I vigilantly flicked my gaze over to the wall at every hint of a noise.

I was gradually becoming more comfortable in the bed once again, mindlessly flipping between apps on my cheap phone.  If humans use ten percent of their brain in daily activity, I estimate I was bordering on using less than one.  But as it turns out, life isn't all sunshine and rainbows-- no, sometimes, it's much more comparable to a waiter who's immeasurably rude to you, and proceeds to spit in your food when you don't say ``thank you'' to his awful behavior.  Case-in-point:  tonight.

Scratch.  Scratch.  Scratch.  It was more clear this time-- I had left one of my earbuds hanging limply at my side in my paranoia, and I could hear it for sure.  It continued on for a good ten seconds, if my concept of time served me well.

Holy crap, it was alive.

I scrambled out of bed like a cat trying to rapidly change direction while running at full speed on a hardwood floor.  The comforter flew from the bed like debris after I, the tempest, threw them from the bed with unrivaled speed.  I flicked the light switch and assumed a defensive stance, knees bent and eyes wide.  My heart pounded like the kick drum of a death metal song.  The air in my lungs suspended itself as I looked at the wall in horror.  Bugs?  Mice?  I didn't care what it was in that wall.  From the sound of it, this thing could crawl with its evil little legs across my skin, against my will.  This wouldn't do at all.  Sleeping was now not an option;  I had too much evidence that there was something in that looming wall, be it a rat, a rabbit or a chimera.

When a few minutes had come to pass, I was still shaken, but had gained some composure and now stood properly.  As I faced the wall, I declared the wall my mortal enemy, and my facial expression agreed with the sentiment.  Whether in heroic resolve or in mere recklessness, I was going to confront this invisible foe, no matter what.  I tentatively tiptoed over towards the wall, my eyes unblinking as if I were face-to-face with a beast on the Sahara.  To this day, I don't actually know why I deemed this an appropriate response.  What was I going to do?  Punch through the wall, insulation and all?

I finally stood three feet from the wall.  Final countdown, the moment before death, yada yada yada.  I braced myself for the worst possible.  For all I knew, mini Godzilla may be waiting on the other side of these paper thin walls.  Maybe I would be greeted by the Predator.  Jason Voorhees could be dropping by for a visit!  Nothing good ever happens after 12:00 AM.  In a last-ditch effort do something, I rapped my knuckles against the wall.

I'll repeat that.  I rapped my knuckles against the wall, like an idiot.  It was more of an anticlimax than any other disappointment I'd witnessed in my life.  It was like a horror movie buildup without the great reveal.  So what did this gamble yield?

Scratch, scritch, scratch.  Scratch.  Scramble.

Nope.  Not worth it.  I wasn't mentally prepared to deal with this.  Recoiling twice as hard as I had before, I effectively gained superhuman capabilities for a split second and flew across the room without a single conscious thought.  I sat on the bed, now without comforters, in nothing but briefs and a T-shirt, under the dull overhead light.  As I grappled with the current situation, frustrated and grunting, I reached in the dark for an idea to pluck out.  The idea I called for hit me out of nowhere.  Now, I was beginning to feel hopeful;  I felt like I might have a way out of this.  A calm expression returned to my face.  I turned the knob to the door leading out of my room.  I evacuated the room, with a blanket and pillow in one hand and an undeserved sense of pride in the other.

``Guess I'll sleep on the couch, then.''

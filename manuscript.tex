So there I was, sitting on a bed in a house we'd rented in South Dakota.  I was probably ``multitasking'' by messaging correspondents about programming on something like Discord and half-watching Netflix or whatever I was on a binge of at the time.  I sat there, convinced I was doing something when I really wasn't doing anything except decreasing my life expectancy.  The way I sat made me look like I was on the verge of adding 'second chin' to my list of defining characteristics.

I think the digital clock at my bedside, looking straight out of the 90s with its blocky red LCD digits, read around 12:30 at the time.  A.M., that is.  My parents would've been thoroughly disappointed had they known I was fooling around on the internet at a time like this, but I thought I needed ``sleep'' like I thought I needed water:  I required just enough to get me through the day.  I was nearing the point of merging into the bed entirely at the time when I was suddenly drawn back to planet Earth by a noise.

It came to my ears as a sort of stone crumbling.  Crumbling, like some kind of fragile, chalky stone falling down stairs.  The wall opposite to my bed seemed to be its source.  I hoped to god that this house wasn't caving in.  Rather than resorting to reason, my mind instinctively assumed this was some omen foretelling that the house, in all umpteen tons of its woody aesthetic and beautiful architecture, would cave in on my poor soul.  The noise stopped as suddenly as it appeared, though, and didn't come back for a good while.  After a minute, my heart rate settled.  Even then, though, as I continued to do absolutely nothing, I vigilantly flicked my gaze over to the wall at every hint of a noise.

I was gradually becoming more comfortable in the bed once again, mindlessly flipping between apps on my cheap phone.  If humans use ten percent of their brain in daily activity, I estimate I was bordering on using less than one.  But as it turns out, life isn't all sunshine and rainbows-- no, sometimes, it's much more comparable to a waiter who's immeasurably rude to you, and proceeds to spit in your food when you don't say ``thank you'' to his awful behavior.  Case-in-point:  tonight.

Scratch.  Scratch.  Scratch.  It was more clear this time-- I had left one of my earbuds hanging limply at my side in my paranoia, and I could hear it for sure.  It continued on for a good ten seconds, if my concept of time served me well.

Holy crap.  This thing wasn't stone, it was alive.

The air in my lungs froze like an absolute social recluse trying to match a store clerk's small talk.  To give some background, I hate anything that could crawl on, or touch against, my skin, save for people or pets.  The strength with which I threw that floral comforter from the bed could probably rival that of an javelin-throwing Olympian.  I scrambled off the bed and to the light switch to the right.  I stood there shaking as I quickly flipped the switch, and stared at the wall like I was being held at gunpoint.  Suddenly, the thought of being crushed and suffocated under immeasurable amounts of plywood and drywall was much more welcomed.

After collecting some portion of my composure, I tentatively tiptoed halfway to the wall.  I was then kindly greeted by more scrambling.  I stopped dead in my tracks, with my bare feet planted firmly on the rough carpet.  At the time, disgust and fear seemed to have been chiseled into my face since time immemorial.

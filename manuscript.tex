I sat up in the dark, under a pink floral cover on a queen mattress.  My small Samsung Galaxy tablet laid on the bed beside me, its screen bathing the ceiling a blue glow.  A noise reverberated around the room, and held my attention.  I peered suspiciously, trying to make out any image revealed by the faint moonlight which shone in through the slatted window.  The lack of discernible sound only served to punctuate that noise.  All the everyday sources of light and sound I had become accustomed to-- the suburban symphony of purring engines, passing headlights, whistling air conditioning and glowing streetlamps-- had absented.

The word 'disquietude' fit this situation like the last piece of a puzzle.  I uneasily pushed my earbuds back in to quiet the silence and turned up the volume for good measure.  I relaxed, lowering myself back down to the pillow and regaining my second chin as my gaze fixed to my device once again.  As I returned to the lull, I believed the storm to have cleared around me.  In reality, I had only passed into the eye of it.

\textit{Crumble crumble.}  The noise had returned.  Having better recognized the sound, I rolled off the bed like a sideways whirling dervish.  I flicked the light switch and assuming a defensive stance.  The overhead light flooded the room with a stale yellow light.  Crumbling?  \textit{Are the walls breaking?}, I worried, casting glances in all directions.  Though some portion of me knew that my parents would never, never, never rent a house which showed any semblance of decay or danger, I couldn't help but ponder the idea.

My gaze held onto the wall opposite to my bed; surely the sound had originated there.  It had been adorned with a few landscape paintings and displayed an unassuming door to what I believed to be a closet.  The wooden door-- locked, as I had discovered when I tried to turn its brass handle earlier that day-- felt foreboding.  The firm, tan carpet, laid thinly over a base of a stony material, felt hard against my bare feet.  I felt uneasy as I sensed myself moving forward unconsciously.

My feet had brought me halfway across the eerie room when I began to act consciously again.  I paused in my tracks, and thought to myself hesitantly.  \textit{What was I going to do here?}  The act of thinking ahead always came as a challenge to me;  this night made me painfully aware of that.  Assuming something \textit{did} lie beyond that wall, what could I do?  I continued towards the wall, rigidly and awkward like a Lego character, when I was sent headlong and flailing into an unfortunate chain of events with a final destination of Hell itself.

A frantic scratch emanated from the wall and resounded throughout the room.  At once, I knew what was entrapped beyond that wall.  The telltale sound of skittering and scratching against paper shook me at my knees.  With the grace of a drunken Olympian gymnast, I flew backwards onto the bed.  Spring physics refused to let the mattress receive my body, and sent me bouncing back into the air, leaving me just short of hitting my head on the ornately carved headboard.  I bordered on hyperventilation as I lay dazed, my body coursing with adrenaline.

I collected myself, and stood up beside my bed.  I tucked two pillows from the bed under one of my arms and clung to the patterned comforter with my free hand.  I struggled to twist open the knob with the hand of my arm.  Moonlight shone in from the window outside of my bedroom.  The bright orb hung in the sky, staring me down.  The comforter dragged lazily behind me as I walked up the stairs, making my way to a very plush-looking couch.  I burrowed under the comforter, now resting uncomfortably on a makeshift bed comprised of a couch and two pillows.  As I tried to block out the glaring white light of the night sky, one thought persisted in my mind.

\textit{God, I hate mice.}
